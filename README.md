# OnTap.py

#### _Parse the Saraveza tap list to identify presence of particular beverages, 4/12/19_

#### By Craig Hutler

## Description

This program leverages the Requests and Beautiful Soup modules to scrape the taplist for my favorite neighborhood bar, Saraveza, and parse that data looking for matches in the list. If a match is found it prints the results to the console.

This was written as an excercise to enhance my Python skills and learn to use Beautiful Soup. I intent to extend the project by hosting in the cloud (AWS Lamba), running the script on a regular cadence, and when a match is found triggering an SMS or email to alert me that one of my favorite beverages is on tap at Saraveza presently.

## Known Bugs
